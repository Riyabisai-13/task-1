  <h1>Task 1:Scan your local network for open ports</h1>

  <!-- Nmap Scan Section -->
  <div class="scan-section">
    <h2>Nmap Scan</h2>
    <p>
      The Nmap scan was conducted to identify open ports and services running on the target device.
      This helps in understanding the attack surface and checking for potential vulnerabilities.
      Common services like msrpc(port 135), netbios-ssn (port 139), microsoft-ds(port 445), and mysql(port 3306) were detected.The figure 1 below shows the open ports and ip adresses.

  <!-- Wireshark Scan Section -->
  <div class="scan-section">
    <h2>Wireshark Analysis</h2>
<p>
      Wireshark was used to capture and analyze network traffic. The screenshot below shows filtered packets 
      based on IP and port, helping identify suspicious traffic patterns, unencrypted data transfers, or malware communication.The figure 2 below shows analyzing packet capture with wireshark.

    <p>
        Potential security risks from open ports:<br>
        1.Unencrypted communication: Since it's Http(not HTTPS),any sensitive data(like messages in chat) is transmitted in plaintext.This could be easily intercepted and read by an attacker on the network.<br>
        2.Chat or Messaging activity: The repeated POST /chat to port 80 suggests some chat or messaging application is being used by the device,likely communicating with a server.<br>
        3.Becuase we see HTTP instaed of HTTPS(port443),the session isn't protected by TLS encryption.
